<h2>Variables</h2>
<p>Variables in JavaScript are declared using one of three keywords: <strong>let</strong>, <strong>const</strong>, or <strong>var</strong>.</p>

<p>let allows you to declare block-level variables. The declared variable is available from the block it is enclosed in.</p>

<p><strong>let a;<br>
let name = "Simon";<br>

// myLetVariable is *not* visible out here<br>

for (let myLetVariable = 0; myLetVariable < 5; myLetVariable++) {<br>
  // myLetVariable is only visible in her<br>
}<br>

// myLetVariable is *not* visible out here</strong><p><br>

<p><strong>const</strong> allows you to declare variables whose values are never intended to change. The variable is available from the block it is declared in.</p>

<p><strong>const Pi = 3.14; // Declare variable Pi<br>
console.log(Pi); // 3.14</strong></p>

<p>A variable declared with const cannot be reassigned.</p>

<p><strong>const Pi = 3.14;<br>
Pi = 1; // will throw an error because you cannot change a constant variable.</strong></p>
<p>const declarations only prevent reassignments â€” they don't prevent mutations of the variable's value, if it's an object.</p>

<p><strong>const obj = {};<br>
obj.a = 1; // no error<br>
console.log(obj); // { a: 1 }</strong></p>

<p>var declarations can have surprising behaviors (for example, they are not block-scoped), and they are discouraged in modern JavaScript code.</p>

<p>If you declare a variable without assigning any value to it, its value is undefined. You can't declare a const variable without an initializer, because you can't change it later anyway.</p>

<p>let and const declared variables still occupy the entire scope they are defined in, and are in a region known as the <strong>temporal dead zone</strong> before the actual line of declaration. This has some interesting interactions with variable shadowing, which don't occur in other languages.</p>

<p><strong>function foo(x, condition) {<br>
  if (condition) {<br>
    console.log(x);<br>
    const x = 2;<br>
    console.log(x);<br>
  }<br>
}<br>

foo(1, true);</strong></p>

<p>In most other languages, this would log "1" and "2", because before the const x = 2 line, x should still refer to the parameter x in the upper scope. In JavaScript, because each declaration occupies the entire scope, this would throw an error on the first console.log: "Cannot access 'x' before initialization". For more information, see the reference page of <strong>let</strong>.</p>

<p>JavaScript is dynamically typed. Types (as described in </strong>the previous section<?strong>) are only associated with values, but not with variables. For let-declared variables, you can always change its type through reassignment.</p>

<p><strong>let a = 1;<br>
a = "foo";</strong></p>
