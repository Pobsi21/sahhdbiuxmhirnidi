<h2>Language and runtime</h2>
<p>Throughout this page, we've constantly mentioned that certain features are language-level while others are runtime-level.</p>

<p>JavaScript is a general-purpose scripting language. The <strong>core language specification</strong> focuses on pure computational logic. It doesn't deal with any input/output â€” in fact, without extra runtime-level APIs (most notably <strong>console.log()</strong>), a JavaScript program's behavior is entirely unobservable.</p>

<p>A runtime, or a host, is something that feeds data to the JavaScript engine (the interpreter), provides extra global properties, and provides hooks for the engine to interact with the outside world. Module resolution, reading data, printing messages, sending network requests, etc. are all runtime-level operations. Since its inception, JavaScript has been adopted in various environments, such as browsers (which provide APIs like <strong>DOM</strong>), Node.js (which provides APIs like <strong>file system access</strong>), etc. JavaScript has been successfully integrated in web (which was its primary purpose), mobile apps, desktop apps, server-side apps, serverless, embedded systems, and more. While you learn about JavaScript core features, it's also important to understand host-provided features in order to put the knowledge to use. For example, you can read about all <strong>web platform APIs</strong>, which are implemented by browsers, and sometimes non-browsers.</p>
