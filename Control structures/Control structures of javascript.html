	    <h1>JavaScript language</h1>
<h2>Control structures</h2>
<p>JavaScript has a similar set of control structures to other languages in the C family. Conditional statements are supported by <strong>if and else</strong>; you can chain them together:</p>

<p><strong>let name = "kittens";<br>
if (name === "puppies") {<br>
  name += " woof";<br>
} else if (name === "kittens") {<br>
  name += " meow";<br>
} else {<br>
  name += "!";<br>
}<br>
name === "kittens meow";</strong></p>

<p>JavaScript doesn't have elif, and else if is really just an else branch comprised of a single if statement.</p>

<p>JavaScript has <strong>while</strong> loops and <strong>do...while</strong> loops. The first is good for basic looping; the second is for loops where you wish to ensure that the body of the loop is executed at least once:</p>

<p><strong>while (true) {<br>
  // an infinite loop!<br>
}<br>

let input;<br>
do {<br>
  input = get_input();<br>
} while (inputIsNotValid(input));</strong><p>

<p>JavaScript's <strong>for loop</strong> is the same as that in C and Java: it lets you provide the control information for your loop on a single line.</p>

<p><strong>for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {<br>
  // Will execute 5 times<br>
}</strong></p>

<p>JavaScript also contains two other prominent for loops: <strong>for...of</strong>, which iterates over iterables, most notably arrays, and <strong>for...in</strong>, which visits all <strong>enumerable</strong> properties of an object.</p>

<p><strong>for (const value of array) {<br>
  // do something with value<br>
}<br>

for (const property in object) {<br>
  // do something with object property<br>
}</strong></p>

<p>The switch statement can be used for multiple branches based on equality checking.</p>

<p><strong>switch (action) {<br>
  case "draw":<br>
    drawIt();<br>
    break;<br>
  case "eat":<br>
    eatIt();<br>
    break;<br>
  default:<br>
    doNothing();<br>
}</strong></p>

<p>Similar to C, case clauses are conceptually the same as <strong>labels</strong>, so if you don't add a break statement, execution will "fall through" to the next level. However, they are not actually jump tables — any expression can be part of the case clause, not just string or number literals, and they would be evaluated one-by-one until one equals the value being matched. Comparison takes place between the two using the === operator.</p>

<p>Unlike some languages like Rust, control-flow structures are statements in JavaScript, meaning you can't assign them to a variable, like const a = if (x) { 1 } else { 2 }.</p>

<p>JavaScript errors are handled using the <strong>try...catch</strong> statement.</p>

<p><strong>try {<br>
  buildMySite("./website");<br>
} catch (e) {<br>
  console.error("Building site failed:", e);<br>
}</strong></p>

<p>Errors can be thrown using the <strong>throw</strong> statement. Many built-in operations may throw as well.</p>

<p><strong>function buildMySite(siteDirectory) {<br>
  if (!pathExists(siteDirectory)) {<br>
    throw new Error("Site directory does not exist");<br>
  }<br>
}</strong></p>

<p>In general, you can't tell the type of the error you just caught, because anything can be thrown from a throw statement. However, you can usually assume it's an <strong>Error</strong> instance, as is the example above. There are some subclasses of Error built-in, like <strong>TypeError</strong> and <strong>RangeError</strong>, that you can use to provide extra semantics about the error. There's no conditional catch in JavaScript — if you only want to handle one type of error, you need to catch everything, identify the type of error using <strong>instanceof</strong>, and then rethrow the other cases.

<p><strong>try {<br>
  buildMySite("./website");<br>
} catch (e) {<br>
  if (e instanceof RangeError) {<br>
    console.error("Seems like a parameter is out of range:", e);<br>
    console.log("Retrying...");<br>
    buildMySite("./website");<br>
  } else {<br>
    // Don't know how to handle other error types; throw them so<br>
    // something else up in the call stack may catch and handle it<br>
    throw e;<br>
  }<br>
}</strong></p>

<p>If an error is uncaught by any try...catch in the call stack, the program will exit.</p>
