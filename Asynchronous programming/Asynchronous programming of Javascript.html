	    <h1>JavaScript language</h1>
<h2>Asynchronous programming</h2>
<p>JavaScript is single-threaded by nature. There's no <strong>paralleling</strong>; only <strong>concurrency</strong>. Asynchronous programming is powered by an <strong>event loop</strong>, which allows a set of tasks to be queued and polled for completion.</p>

<p>There are three idiomatic ways to write asynchronous code in JavaScript:</p>

<p>*Callback-based (such as <strong>setTimeout</strong>())<br>
*<strong>Promise</strong>-based<br>
*<strong>async</strong>/<strong>await</strong>, which is a syntactic sugar for Promises</p>

</p>For example, here's how a file-read operation may look like in JavaScript:</p>
<p><strong>// Callback-based<br>
fs.readFile(filename, (err, content) => {<br>
  // This callback is invoked when the file is read, which could be after a while<br>
  if (err) {<br>
    throw err;<br>
  }<br>
  console.log(content);<br>
});<br>
// Code here will be executed while the file is waiting to be read<br>

// Promise-based<br>
fs.readFile(filename)<>br
  .then((content) => {<br>
    // What to do when the file is read<br>
    console.log(content);<br>
  })<br>
  .catch((err) => {<br>
    throw err;<br>
  });<br>
// Code here will be executed while the file is waiting to be read<br>

// Async/await<br>
async function readFile(filename) {<br>
  const content = await fs.readFile(filename);<br>
  console.log(content);<br>
}</strong></p>

<p>The core language doesn't specify any asynchronous programming features, but it's crucial when interacting with the external environment — from <strong>asking user permissions</strong>, to <strong>fetching data</strong>, to <strong>reading files</strong>. Keeping the potentially long-running operations async ensures that other processes can still run while this one waits — for example, the browser will not freeze while waiting for the user to click a button to grant permission.</p>

<p>If you have an async value, it's not possible to get its value synchronously. For example, if you have a promise, you can only access the eventual result via the <strong>then()</strong> method. Similarly, await can only be used in an async context, which is usually an async function or a module. Promises are never blocking — only the logic depending on the promise's result will be deferred; everything else continues to execute in the meantime. If you are a functional programmer, you may recognize promises as <strong>monads</strong> which can be mapped with then() (however, they are not proper monads because they auto-flatten; i.e. you can't have a Promise<Promise<T>>).</p>

<p>In fact, the single-threaded model has made Node.js a popular choice for server-side programming due to its non-blocking IO, making handling a large number of database or file-system requests very performant. However, CPU-bound (computationally intensive) tasks that are pure JavaScript will still block the main thread. To achieve real paralleling, you may need to use <strong>workers</strong>.</p>
